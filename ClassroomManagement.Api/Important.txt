Features Required:
1. when given teacher Id all schedules of him/her in the entire week will be shown.
2. when given Room Id all schedules of him/her in the entire week will be shown.
3. when given Level-Term and Sec all schedules of him/her in the entire week will be shown.

Suggestion:
when starting scheduling for a day first check for the lab if it can be given after break if not check all the labs in the list then if 
none can be given then try to put before break if even that doesnt work then put all courses.

If 0.75 credit course exists then will have to plan for even and odd week


Problems:
1. LevelTerm navigation property on Classroom table
2. Sessional<-->Labroom many to many relation so cant add navigation properties with HasData()...need UI like SwaggerGen.
3. need to convert Term in LevelTerm table from int to string.
